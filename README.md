## Data Transformation

This data is an excel file. It is a single file. Power query is basically used for this data transfromation. The rating column had some mising values,  the average of the  rating was used to fill the missing values. the column addres was splitted using the delimiter "," at the left most occurrence to sepatare the area from the streets. then review columns has over 50 perent of the information missing, so i removed it so as not to have bias analysis.

  From the analysis, the following are recommended:

   - Hotels business is very lucrative expecially when world class facilities are available.
 
   - Ikeja, lekki and Victoria Island has a large market for hotel, so if you intend to venture into this business, these three areas are very important.
 
   - I personally recommend building shotlet appartments instead of the traditonal room ensuites, as the demand for this has been on the increase, since people come to Lagos for 
      vacation and tourist too.
 
## Disclaimer

This analysis covered only regsitered and near five star hotels and not for makeshift hotels around so the cost mght be very high compare to some localities based on the facilities available.
